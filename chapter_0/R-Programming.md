# Unit 0: R Programming
## Introduction to R

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is widely used among statisticians and data miners for data analysis. R is ideal for machine and statistical learning operations such as regression and classification. 

As of June 2023, R ranks 11th in the TIOBE index, a measure of programming language popularity, in which the language peaked in 8th place in August 2020. In this R tutorial, we will start by learning what exactly is R. 

R is an open-source programming language,  it can be downloaded and installed for free. It is cross-platform compatible language, one can run the same R code in multiple operating systems. With the help of R language, one is able to implement various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, etc. This is the link to R [Click me!](https://cran.r-project.org/).

## History of R
R is a programming language developed by *Ross Ihaka* and *Robert Gentleman* at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. In April 2003, the R Foundation was founded as a non-profit organization to provide further support for the R project.
