# Unit 0: R Programming
## Unit 0.1: Introduction to R

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is widely used among statisticians and data miners for data analysis. R is ideal for machine and statistical learning operations such as regression and classification. 

As of June 2023, R ranks 11th in the TIOBE index, a measure of programming language popularity, in which the language peaked in 8th place in August 2020. In this R tutorial, we will start by learning what exactly is R.

R is an open-source programming language,  it can be downloaded and installed for free. It is cross-platform compatible language, one can run the same R code in multiple operating systems. With the help of R language, one is able to implement various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, etc.

## Unit 0.2: History of R
R is an interpreted computer programming language created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand where the R Development Core Team, created in 1997, currently develops it. In April 2003, the R Foundation was founded as a non-profit organization to provide further support for the R project. In 1995, R was made a free and open-source software under the GNU General Public Licence. The first official release came in 1995 followed by the first ‘stable beta’ version (v1.0) released on 29th February 2000.
