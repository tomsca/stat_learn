# Unit 2: Statistical Learning

## Introduction to Statistical Learning:

- Definition of statistical learning:
  - It involves developing models to understand relationships between variables in a dataset and make predictions or decisions based on those relationships.
- The goal of statistical learning:
  - To find a model that accurately predicts the outcome variable given the input variables.

## Types of Learning:

- Supervised learning:
  - Learning from labeled data, where the outcome variable is known for the training examples.
  - Unsupervised learning: Learning from unlabeled data, where the goal is to find patterns or structure in the data.
  - Semisupervised learning: Learning from a combination of labeled and unlabeled data.

## Statistical Learning Framework:

- Variables:
  - The input and output variables used in the learning process.
- Training Data:
  - Data used to build the statistical learning model.
- Test Data:
  - Independent data used to evaluate the model's performance.
- Prediction Function:
  - The function used to predict the outcome variable based on the input variables.
- Error/Fitness Measure:
 - A metric used to assess how well the model fits the training data.
- Model Complexity:
  - The flexibility or complexity of the model, which affects its ability to capture underlying patterns.

## Assessing Model Accuracy:

- Training error:
  - The error rate of a model when applied to the training data.
- Test error:
  - The error rate of a model when applied to independent test data.
- Bias-variance tradeoff:
  - The tradeoff between the flexibility and the accuracy of a model.

## Overfitting and Underfitting:

- Overfitting:
  -W hen a model is too complex and captures noise or random fluctuations in the training data, leading to poor generalization to new data.
- Underfitting:
  - When a model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data.

## Model Selection:

- Cross-validation:
  - A technique to estimate the test error of a model by splitting the data into training and validation sets.
- Bias-variance tradeoff in model selection:
  - Selecting a model that strikes a balance between model complexity and accuracy.
